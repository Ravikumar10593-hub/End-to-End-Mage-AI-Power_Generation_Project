# Mage AI üßô: End to End Powerüí™ Generation Projectüõ£Ô∏è

This project will cover an end to end example of how to use Mage-AI for ETL/ELT process.

## Problem Statement
**Power Generation Analysis and Optimization Project**

The project aims to analyze and optimize power generation data using modern data engineering and analytics tools. By leveraging data from Kaggle and performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations using Mage, the project will export transformed data to SQL Server for further analysis and visualization in Power BI. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to enhance power generation efficiency and decision-making processes.
